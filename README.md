# Diabetes-prediction
The primary objective of this project is to build an accurate and reliable machine learning model that can predict the presence of diabetes in patients based on key medical attributes
Methodology
The methodology adopted in this project follows a structured data mining and
machine learning pipeline

 Machine Learning Models
The following models were trained and evaluated:
. Logistic Regression
. Decision Tree Classifier
• Support Vector Machine (SVM)
• K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
• Random Forest Classifier
Streamlit Web Application
To make the model accessible and easy to use, a web-based application was
developed using Streamlit. The application allows users to input individual
patient data through a user-friendly interface and receive an instant prediction
result.
